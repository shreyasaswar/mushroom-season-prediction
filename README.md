## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to classify mushrooms based on their characteristics and predict the best season for their growth. We've used a dataset containing 173 species of mushrooms from 23 closely related families, with 21 feature attributes.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding (Label and One-hot)
- Correlation analysis
- Machine Learning model implementation
- Handling imbalanced data with SMOTE

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

We've implemented and compared 8 different machine learning models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Gaussian Naïve Bayes
4. Linear SVC
5. Stochastic Gradient Descent
6. Decision Tree Classifier
7. Random Forest Classifier
8. Gradient Boosting Trees

## 📊 Results

After oversampling with SMOTE:

- Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy (82%)
- K-Nearest Neighbors model came in second (71%)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- SQL
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
